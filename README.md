# Basic-Machine-Learning-C

This project was a homework for Yıldız Technical University.

This is a small image-classification project built entirely in C.
It reads 28×28 grayscale images, turns them into flat vectors, and tries to tell apart two classes (A and B) using a simple classifier with a tanh activation.

The project includes three different training methods: Gradient Descent, SGD, and Adam and logs how the weights, loss, and accuracy change over time so you can see how each optimizer behaves.
